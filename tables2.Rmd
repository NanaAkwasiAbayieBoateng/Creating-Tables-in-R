## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
options(digits = 4)
set.seed(123)
x = matrix(rnorm(40), 5)
x
dimnames(x) = list(NULL, head(LETTERS, ncol(x)))
x
# further customization via kable(), e.g. digits and captions
knitr::kable(x, digits = 2, caption = 'A table produced by printr.')

knitr::kable(head(mtcars), digits = 2, caption = 'A table produced by printr.')

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
